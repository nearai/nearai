!!! tip

## Login to NEAR AI

To create a new agent, first login with a [NEAR Account](https://wallet.near.org/):

``` bash
nearai login
```

??? tip "Don't have a NEAR Account?"

    If you do not have a NEAR account, you can create one for free using wallets listed at [wallet.near.org](https://wallet.near.org/). 
    
    If you are unsure of which one to choose, try out [Bitte](https://wallet.bitte.ai) or [Meteor Wallet](https://wallet.meteorwallet.app/add_wallet/create_new).

You'll be provided with a URL to login with your NEAR account.

Example:

``` bash
$> nearai login

Please visit the following URL to complete the login process: https://auth.near.ai?message=Welcome+to+NEAR+AI&nonce=<xyzxyzxyzxyzx>&recipient=ai.near&callbackUrl=http%3A%2F%2Flocalhost%3A63130%2Fcapture
```

After successfully logging in, you will see a confirmation screen. Close it and return to your terminal.

??? tip "Other Login Methods"

    If you have already logged in on `near-cli`, you know your account's private key, or you have the credentials on another device, you can use the following commands to login:

    ```bash
    ### Login with NEAR Account ID Only
    nearai login --accountId name.near

    ### Login with Account ID and Private Key
    nearai login --accountId name.near --privateKey key

    ### Login Remotely (only displays the login URL)
    nearai login --remote
    ```
